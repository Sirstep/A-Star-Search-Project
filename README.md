# A-Star-Search-Project
Simple yet scalable application that demonstrates the A* Search algorithm.

Future updates:
  1. Allow larger maps (2x2 - 50x50)
    -> Take out ???
  2. Add scroller to open and closed list
  3. Fix agent location after closing final path window
  4. Adjust tile labels
    -> Color code
    -> Possibly place all on left edge of tile
      ( Utilize tiny font for overflow caused by small window size )
  5. Replace pop up window with path highlighting
    -> Redden path tiles
    -> Darken tiles not in path
    -> Make into a transition? (fade)
  6. Fix aglorithm to select lowest h value
  7. Add "percent of tiles blocked" tool
